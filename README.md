This is the github project for the Hearts of Iron 4 mod "Years Gone By" Set in a dystopian future where the world has been bombed back into a sort of futuristic yet primitive stage. It draws inspiration from Fallout, The walking dead, and other similar end-of-the-world stories. But in this story the focus is not on the single people surviving the wasteland, rather this mod tries to use Hearts of Iron to simulate the rise of new nations following the rebirth of humanity, hundreds of years after the old world order fell apart.
