 novgorod.1.t: "The ambitions of man"
 novgorod.1.d: "Lyeningrad is the name of a city that rose from the ashes like a phoenix, and through the guidance of Uruk the great it swallowed up many aspiring smaller powers within the lifespan of one man. But an empire so hungry and greedy, that yearns for more than it can stomoach, often looses it all. Uruk the Second was crowned only ten years ago, being seated on the throne his father had carved out of gold and blood. Three years later, that throne would be soot and ash. The Frozen War had raged for many years, destroying large parts of the country, as nomads in the east pillaged with little resistance and the west was caught in a brutal and bloody form of stagnant warfare. It was too much for the empire, and after many years the echoes of riots, revolutions and the ever approaching flame of war and death caused Uruk II to throw in the towel. \n Now in the aftermath of this disaster, With the country in flames and the coffers being siphoned by foreign lands, he must rally his people to rebuild and reclaim the glory his father bestowed upon them by proving their superiority over their overlods! \n Some, however, disagree with his approach. The son of Uruk II, Rauvind, is not a man of caution or a man of prowess. He is a young man talented in the arts of deciet and intrigue, and he seeks to make sure Lyeningrad is reborn in his image"
